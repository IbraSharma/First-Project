# First-Project
This project is basic programing in porpuse to demonstrate my skills as programing python progress. 
In this project l requested data from using free api 'https://punkapi.com/'. 
Request returns multiple items limited to 25 results by default.
https://api.punkapi.com/v2/beers?PARAMETER
PARAMETER can be one of the items that publish in that web. 
I chose Food parameter to Returns all beers matching the supplied food string.

Get Random Beer:
Pick up random beer from the API, this takes no paramaters.

How works:
user input name 
user input food choice
user requested to answer recomndation (yes/no/abv)
if yes, print recomdation
if abv, select % abv to collect beer > abv selected
if no, quite and break exit from loop.
